.PP 
Unless the \-\-help or \-h option is given, one of the above commands
must be present\&.
.PP
Repository configuration is honored in all operations.
.PP 
.IP "\fBinstall\fP"
Is used to install the latest version of a package or
group of packages while ensuring that all dependencies are
satisfied\&.  If no package matches the given package name(s), they are
assumed to be a shell glob and any matches are then installed\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBupdate\fP"
If run without any packages, update will update every currently
installed package.  If one or more packages are specified, Yum will
only update the listed packages\&.  While updating packages, \fByum\fP
will ensure that all dependencies are satisfied\&.  If no package
matches the given package name(s), they are assumed to be a shell glob
and any matches are then installed\&. 

If the \-\-obsoletes flag is present \fByum\fP will include package 
obsoletes in its calculations - this makes it better for distro\-version 
changes, for example: upgrading from somelinux 8.0 to somelinux 9.
.IP 
.IP "\fBcheck\-update\fP"
Implemented so you could know if your machine had any updates that needed to
be applied without running it interactively. Returns exit value of 100 if
there are packages available for an update. Also returns a list of the pkgs
to be updated in list format. Returns 0 and no packages are available for
update.
.IP
.IP "\fBupgrade\fP"
Is the same as the update command with the \-\-obsoletes flag set. See update 
for more details.
.IP 
.IP "\fBremove\fP or \fBerase\fP"
Are used to remove the specified packages from the system
as well as removing any packages which depend on the package being
removed\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBlist\fP"
Is used to list various information about available
packages; more complete details are available in the \fIList Options\fP
section below\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBprovides\fP or \fBwhatprovides\fP"
Is used to find out which package provides some feature
or file. Just use a specific name or a file-glob-syntax wildcards to list
the packages available or installed that provide that feature or file\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBsearch\fP"
Is used to find any packages matching a string in the description, summary,
packager and package name fields of an rpm. Useful for finding a package
you do not know by name but know by some word related to it. 
.IP 
.IP "\fBinfo\fP"
Is used to list a description and summary information about available
packages; takes the same arguments as in the \fIList Options\fP
section below\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBclean\fP"
Is used to clean up various things which accumulate in the
\fByum\fP cache directory over time.  More complete details can be found in
the \fIClean Options\fP section below\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBshell\fP"
Is used to enter the 'yum shell', when a filename is specified the contents of
that file is executed in yum shell mode. See \fIyum-shell(8)\fP for more info
.IP
.IP "\fBresolvedep\fP"
Is used to list packages providing the specified dependencies, at most one
package is listed per dependency. 
.IP
.IP "\fBlocalinstall\fP"
Is used to install a set of local rpm files. If required the enabled 
repositories will be used to resolve dependencies. 
.IP
.IP "\fBlocalupdate\fP"
Is used to update the system by specifying local rpm files. Only the specified 
rpm files of which an older version is already installed will be installed,
the remaining specified packages will be ignored.
If required the enabled repositories will be used to resolve dependencies.
.IP
.IP "\fBdeplist\fP"
Produces a list of all dependencies and what packages provide those
dependencies for the given packages.
.IP
.PP
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"

.PP 
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"

.PP 
.SH "LIST OPTIONS"
The following are the ways which you can invoke \fByum\fP in list
mode\&.  Note that all \fBlist\fP commands include information on the
version of the package\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fByum list [all | glob_exp1] [glob_exp2] [\&.\&.\&.]\fP"
List all available and installed packages\&.
.IP "\fByum list available [glob_exp1] [\&.\&.\&.]\fP"

List all packages with updates available in the yum repositories\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fByum list installed [glob_exp1] [\&.\&.\&.]\fP"

match the name of an available package, it is assumed to be a
shell\-style glob and any matches are printed\&.
.IP
.IP "\fByum list extras [glob_exp1] [\&.\&.\&.]\fP"
List the packages installed on the system that are not available in any yum
repository listed in the config file.
.IP
.IP "\fByum list obsoletes [glob_exp1] [\&.\&.\&.]\fP"

in any yum repository listed in the config file.
.IP
.IP "\fByum list recent\fP"
List packages recently added into the repositories. 
.IP
.IP "\fBSpecifying package names\fP"
All the list options mentioned above take file-glob-syntax wildcards or package
names as arguments, for example \fByum list available 'foo*'\fP will list
all available packages that match 'foo*'. (The single quotes will keep your
shell from expanding the globs.)
.IP
.PP 
.SH "CLEAN OPTIONS"
The following are the ways which you can invoke \fByum\fP in clean
mode. Note that "all files" in the commands below means 
"all files in currently enabled repositories". 
If you want to also clean any (temporarily) disabled repositories you need to
use \fB--enablerepo='*'\fP option.

.IP "\fByum clean packages\fP"
Eliminate any cached packages from the system.  Note that packages are not automatically deleted after they are downloaded.

.IP "\fByum clean headers\fP"
Eliminate all of the header files which yum uses for dependency resolution.

.IP "\fByum clean metadata\fP"
Eliminate all of the files which yum uses to determine the remote
availability of packages. Using this option will force yum to download all the 
metadata the next time it is run.

.IP "\fByum clean dbcache\fP"
Eliminate the sqlite cache used for faster access to metadata.
Using this option will force yum to recreate the cache the next time
it is run.

.IP "\fByum clean all\fP"
Runs \fByum clean packages\fP and \fByum clean headers\fP as above.

.PP
.SH "MISC"
.IP "\fBSpecifying package names\fP"
A package can be referred to for install,update,list,remove etc with any 
of the following:
.IP
.br
\fBname\fP
.br
\fBname.arch\fP
.br
\fBname-ver\fP
.br
\fBname-ver-rel\fP
.br
\fBname-ver-rel.arch\fP
.br
\fBname-epoch:ver-rel.arch\fP

\fBepoch:name-ver-rel.arch\fP
.IP
For example: \fByum remove kernel-2.4.1-10.i686\fP

.PP 
.SH "PLUGINS"
Yum can be extended through the use of plugins. A plugin is a Python ".py" file
which is installed in one of the directories specified by the \fBpluginpath\fP
option in yum.conf. For a plugin to work, the following conditions must be met:
.LP
1. The plugin module file must be installed in the plugin path as just
described.
.LP
2. The global \fBplugins\fP option in /etc/yum.conf must be set to `1'.
.LP
3. A configuration file for the plugin must exist in
/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/<plugin_name>.conf and the \fBenabled\fR setting in this
file must set to `1'. The minimal content for such a configuration file is:
.IP
[main]
.br
enabled = 1
.LP
See the \fByum.conf(5)\fR man page for more information on plugin related
configuration options.
