.SH "PARAMETERS"

There are two types of sections in the yum.conf file: main and server. Main defines all the global configuration options. The server section(s) define the entries for each server.
.SH "[main] options"
.LP 
The [main] section must exist for yum to do anything. It consists of the following options:

.IP \fBcachedir\fR
directory where yum should store its cache and db files.

.IP \fBdebuglevel\fR
debug level. valid numbers are 0\-10.
default is 2.

.IP \fBerrorlevel\fR
debug level. valid numbers are 0\-2.
default is 2.

.IP \fBlogfile\fR
full directory and file name for where yum should write its log file.

.IP \fBassumeyes\fR
1 or 0 - tells yum whether or not to prompt you for confirmation of actions.
Same as -y on the command line. Default to 0.

.IP \fBpkgpolicy=\fI[newest|last]\fR
Default: \fInewest\fR.  Package sorting order.  When a package is available from 
multiple servers, \fInewest\fR will install the most recent version of the package 
found. \fIlast\fR will sort the servers alphabetically by \fBserverid\fR and 
install the version of the package found on the last server in the resulting list.
If you don't understand the above then you're best left not including this option at 
all and letting the default occur.

.IP \fBexclude\fR

Filename globs *,?,., etc are allowed

.IP \fBexactarch\fR

on the command line. ie: commands  = update foo bar baz quux
none of the short options (-y, -e, -d, etc) will be taken in the field.
