urlgrabber -- A high-level cross-protocol url-grabber

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

If you want to install urlgrabber on your system, simply open the package 
and run:

   python setup.py install
   
Take a look at the install options by doing

   python setup.py install --help
   
If you are on a Red Hat Linux machine that still uses python 1.5.x by
default, you may need to run python2 in place of python above.  Note
that urlgrabber 0.3 and later will work for pre-2.0 python.

With no arguments, distutils will add all modules to a 'urlgrabber'
package under your python site-packages directory. 

keepalive.py and byterange.py are generic urllib2 extension modules and
can be used to add keepalive and range support to any urllib2 
application.
